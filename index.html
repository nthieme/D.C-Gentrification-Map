    <h1>D.C,'s modern gentrification</h1>
                <p class="p5">British sociologist Ruth Glass gave the word "gentrify" its modern meaning in 1964, turning the word gentry into a verb to describe the invasion of working class neighborhoods by the middle and upper classes. Five years after Glass coined the word, humans walked on the moon. Less than a decade later, Apple started selling its first commercial computer, the Apple II, and today, the my phone's GPS constantly solves Einstein's equations as it navigates me across the city. Yet with the way technology has changed, changed us, and changed the way we live, we still wait to see hard hats and scaffolding before we say a neighborhood is being gentrified. Technology provides new indicators of wealth, and by noticing where new technologies appear, we can spot changing demographics before they're completely changed.</p>

<p>Unlike gentrification as it's typically understood, technological gentrification&ndash;the replacement of traditional, less-expensive technologies by newer, more-exclusive ones&ndash;can happen literally overnight. If you can afford it, it takes just a second to spend a grand on the new iPhone, no amount of money can make a Starbucks sprout in a second like Jack's beanstalk.</p>

<p class="p5">This kind of change might seem insignificant or irrelevant compared to families being displaced from the places they grew up. After all, displacement is the real crime of gentrification. That's why technological gentrification is meant to supplement gentrification as a housing-based phenomenon, not replace it. Seen like that, it's another nail in the coffin of the narrative of progress.</p>

 <p class="p5">Traditionally gentrified neighborhoods usually experience decreases in crime and increases in amenities, but the people who reap these benefits are the weathier, whiter, more highly educated gentrifiers. The same is true of technological gentrification in Washington D.C. In 2012, the northeast (NE) and southeast (SE) quadrants of D.C. had comparable percentages of households with high-speed Internet, roughly 70 percent. Today, NE, a quadrant that has been gentrifying for years, has over 80 percent. The rates in SE, while having increased marginally, remain in the low 70's.</p>
<div id="vis", style="float: left; margin-left: 0px ;">

</div>

<p class="p5">The myth, easy to fall into and often made opaque, is that average improvements imply that everyone is better off. The claim is appealing. If I say that there was a 10 percent increase in the number of households with high-speed Internet over the last three years, that points to good news for D.C.'s internet connectivity.</p>

<p class="p5">But in reality, the story is more complicated and less cheerful. The 10 percent increase is really a 20-plus percent increase in southwest (SW) held back by a 5 percent increase in SE.</p>

<p class="p5">While gentrifying neighborhoods are more likely to experience 40 percent and 20 percent increases in high-speed Internet adoption rates,   neighborhoods that "fail" to gentrify are more likely to stagnate or even decrease in speed.</p>

<p class="p5"> The difference is not negligible. Close to 50 percent of gentrifying neighborhoods have seen increases in these adoption rates. For non-gentrifying neighborhoods, that number is below 40 percent.</p>

<p class="p5">Those numbers mean less access to online sources of information. They mean having to use the bank, study, and shop in-person. All of this amounts to greater costs, in terms of both time and money, levied against people who often have neither to spare.</p>

<p class="p5">In 2011, Frank La Rue, former UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, nearly declared Internet access a human right: "Given that the Internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress, ensuring universal access to the Internet should be a priority for all States," La Rue wrote in a report to the U.N Human Rights Council.</p>
<p class="p5"> He continued: "Each State should thus develop a concrete and effective policy...to make the Internet widely available, accessible and affordable to all segments of population." Equal Internet access is one of the cornerstones of the narrative of progress. Unfortunately, the data does not seem to bear it out. </p>

<p class="p5">Another modern indicator of gentrification in D.C. is Capital Bikeshare. Begun in 2010 with a fleet of 1,100 bikes and 114 stations, Capital Bikeshare provide a bike-sharing service in D.C. and its immediate outskirts. Since 2010, the number of available bikes has more than tripled to 3,700, while the number of stations has almost quadrupled to 428. The service is  simple. You pick up a bike from any stations, ride it wherever you need to go, and when you're done using the bike, you find drop it off at any station that has space.</p>

<p class="p5">While it's true there are Capital Bikeshare stations located in all eight wards of the city, there are far fewer in Wards 7 and 8&ndash;two wards largely contained in the SE quadrant of the city&ndash;than there are in the more affluent Wards 1 and 2. Capital Bikeshare seems to wager that there is more money to be made downtown .</p>


<div id="vis", style="float: left; margin-left: 0px ;"> 
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/thieme-us-query/1_images/cabi.svg" alt="Mountain View" style="width:500px;height:500px;">
</div>


<p class="p5">Since 2012, 30 percent of neighborhoods in NE have seen a Capital Bikeshare station show up, compared with only 14 percent of neighborhoods in SE. It's not like SE is saturated with bike-shares the way NW is either. Seventy-eight percent of neighborhoods in NW have stations, while seventy percent of SE neighborhoods have no bike-share stations at all.</p>

<p class="p5">This difference in the construction of bike-share stations is equally prominent if you directly compare neighborhoods that gentrified with neighborhoods that didnt. A neighborhood that didn't gentrify is almost twice as likely not to have a Capital Bikeshare station when compared with a neighborhood that did. And even though gentrifying neighborhoods already have higher concentrations of bike-stations than those that didn't gentrify, the gentrifying neighborhoods continue to see stations built at a higher rate than their counterparts.</p>

<p class="p5">Now a bike-station is, undeniably, a brick and mortar construction. It needs to be planned and built. But, to anyone who has seen one of these stations, it's clear that the construction process can't be long. They're practically bike racks with parking meters. Since a station is much more likely to be built in a neighborhood that is in the process of, or has already completed, gentrification, the building of a new bike-share station can be an early indicator of a gentrifying neighborhood.</p>

<p class="p5">There are many neighborhoods where new bike-share stations are being built and, likewise, where broadband adoption rates have been increasing. Here's an interactive map of D.C., you can use to explore these neighborhoods and potentially discover neighborhoods that are in the process of gentrifying. There's a small description of the map and what it contains beside it. Here are some things to look for:</p>

<p>NE and the northern area of SE are either well on their way to being gentrified or are beginning the process now. Specifically, Gateway/Langdon and Central Northeast have seen increases in Capital Bikeshare stations and ridership, as well as increases in broadband adoption and building permits filed. Lincoln Heights, a bordering neighborhood, has seen increases in bike stations and broadband adoption. With this number of indications that technological, as well as traditional, gentrification is occurring, increases in property values and changes in demographics could follow soon.</p>

<p>There are many other stories to be found here. Historic Anacostia is giving indications it may be gentrifying. On the other hand, George Washington University (GWU), one of the most affluent campuses in the country, has negative ridership and building permit changes because it gentrified long ago. See what you find.</p>
